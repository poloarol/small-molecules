# Small Molecule Generative modelling

Generative modelling has the potential of uncovering novel therapeutics
that modulate targets and thereby affect the downwstream metabolism.

Implementations
---------------
1. Generative Adversarial Networks (Current implementing)
2. Graph Variational AutoEncoder (Currently implementing)
3. Mol-CycleGAN (To be implemented)
4. JT-VAE (To be implemented)

How to Use
----------
TBD
