# Small Molecule Generative modelling

Generative modelling has the potential of uncovering novel therapeutics
that modulate targets and thereby affect the downwstream metabolism.

Implementations

1. [WGAN-GP with R-GCN for the generation of small molecules graphs](https://keras.io/examples/generative/wgan-graphs/) (Current implementing)
2. Graph Variational AutoEncoder (Currently implementing)
3. Mol-CycleGAN (Currently implementing)
4. JT-VAE (To be implemented)

How to Use
